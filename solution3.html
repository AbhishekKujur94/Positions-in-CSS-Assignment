            <p>Wildlife encompasses a diverse array of animal and plant species that inhabit Earth's ecosystems. From the tiniest insects to majestic mammals, wildlife plays an integral role in maintaining ecological balance and biodiversity. These organisms contribute to vital ecosystem services such as pollination, seed dispersal, and nutrient cycling.
