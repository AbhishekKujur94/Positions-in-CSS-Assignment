z-index is a CSS property that controls the stacking order of positioned elements. When elements overlap on a webpage, the z-index property determines which element appears on top of the others. Elements with a higher z-index value are stacked above those with lower values.

Example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<title>Z-Index Example</title>
<style>
  .box{
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    position: absolute;
  }
  .box1{
    background-color: red;
    top: 50px;
    left: 50px;
    z-index: 1;
  }
  .box2{
    background-color: blue;
    top: 100px;
    left: 100px;
    z-index: 2;
  }
  .box3{
    background-color: green;
    top: 150px;
    left: 150px;
    z-index: 3;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div class="box box1"></div>
<div class="box box2"></div>
<div class="box box3"></div>
</body>
</html>

In this Example:

We have three div elements with the class box, each styled to be a square with a width and height of 100 pixels. They are positioned absolutely, meaning their placement is relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.

Each div has a different background color (red, blue, and green) to distinguish them.

The z-index property is applied to each div:
-box1 has a z-index of 1.
-box2 has a z-index of 2.
-box3 has a z-index of 3.

As a result, .box3 will appear on top of .box2, and .box2 will appear on top of .box1, because their z-index values follow this order.
